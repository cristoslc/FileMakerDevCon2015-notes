# FileMakerdevcon2015-notes
Rough storage for my notes from FileMaker Devcon 2015.

## Notes are available in the following formats
 * MindNode - the program in which I take all of my notes. Free trial available at http://mindnode.com/downloads/MindNodeMacDemo.zip.
 * PDF (`.pdf`) - universally portable format. On Github, simply click on the `.pdf` file to get a preview. Can also be opened with any PDF reader, such as https://get.adobe.com/reader/.
 * FreeMind (`.mm`) - a more common MindMap format. Can open with several 100% free programs, such as http://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page or http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
 * Markdown (`.md`) - a simplified text markup language. On Github, just click on the `.md` file to view it in a "pretty" format. Can also be opened with any text editor (loses formatting) or with a dedicated Markdown editor like http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html.
