# Patterns, Signals, and User Experience


## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### You are working with PEOPLE

#### you are not working with machines

#### people have different expectations

- which may vary by the person

### Design is an “analytical game”

#### you need to observe the patterns, predict the reactions, and develop a winning combination of customer experience

### Maintaining consistency and familiarity with the experience is key.

### Use of VERBS for buttons

#### shortest route for building user confidence of “getting things done"

### If users can assign a single verb, or a single task to a block of your content, then that’s a successful design.

### Design is the medium

#### you, as the designer, are creating the method that connects people.

## Quotables

### “Recurrent behaviors form patterns and personalities."

### “Every design challenge is a unique challenge for me.”

#### Chih Hsiao

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

### by analyzing patterns, you will be able to form winning strategies

## UX Design Principles

### Chih’s concerns

#### UX principles aren’t a formula, which can be used to generate a design and automatically be successful every time

#### you can know the principles without understanding how to apply them

## Key Questions

### Do I fully understand the problem?

### What tasks are my users trying to achieve?

### Can I predict my users intent and make recommendations?

### Does my solution make them feel that they could ‘win'?

### Do they think the way that I do?

## Concepts

### I. Pattern

#### You use building blocks and design patterns to solve your problems.

- Corollary: you have to know what problems you have to be solved.

#### Design is about understanding the options you have (patterns) and how to merge them.

- With practice, you will be able to pull patterns out of your pocket without needing to think about it.

#### See Apple’s UI design guidelines page

#### May be many ways to solve the same design problem, using different patterns

- 

#### How many is too many? It’s all about numbers.

- e.g., lists

	- 1 is different from 2

	- 2 is different from 5

	- 5 is different from 10

- general principle also applies to

	- columns & rows

	- object dimensions

	- available choices

	- interactive elements per given space

	- steps to accomplish a task

#### To apply patterns in a consistent way

- articulate your problems

- follow the same guidelines (e.g., Calls to Action in the same place, same style)

### II. Intent

Creating a sense of direction and purpose.

#### Web pages used to be two- or three-columns

- now see more long-scrolling, single-column pages.

	- often with a single interaction point (e.g., CTA button)

#### Six W's

- Who

- What

- Where

- When

- Why

- How

#### Define the use cases

- start with a one-pager that outlines the potential use cases that users might have

	- start in a laundry list form

		- example laundry list

	- build functional groups of the actions

	- define primary & secondary tasks

	- identify the users/user groups

	- data input & output forms (what should go in? what should come out?)

#### Define measurable usability goals

- Example usability goals

### III. Focus

Communicating in clarity

#### The layout dilemma

#### Scan line / attention order

- Example 1 - one scanline

- Example 2 - multiple scanlines

	- How to deal with this?

		- Always focus on getting back to the basics.

		- One column might be ideal, but not always achievable.

		- The more you can remove, the better (even if you can’t remove everything you’d like).

#### If users can assign a single verb, or a single task to a block of your content, then that’s a successful design.

### IV. Scaling up & down

#### You will have to iterate, the right level and composition of simplicity may not be immediately apparent.

#### How do you counter the danger of the “idea branching” process?

- as you think through the user process, new features will suggest themselves

- idea branching and converging may happen at the same time

	- as options continue to grow, may also be trimming / winnowing

#### Once you have the full task list, revisit the one-pager.

## Q & A

### How do you know what the scanlines are? Are they based on research, or intuition?

#### Used to be working at a company with eye-tracking.

#### If eye-tracking is not available, may use a qualitative approach instead.

- e.g., users begin with Task A vs. Task B — so they probably see Task A first

- designers may have an intuitive (but subjective) idea of it

### Do you use personas / are they useful for the approach you described here?

#### Yes, personas are useful.

#### However, depending on the business culture, it can be hard to get agreement on whether the personas you come up with are truly representative / the “right” personas.
