- is that a prerequisite for using D3?

## Q&A

### Do you need Reactor for D3 integration in FM?

#### No, you don’t necessarily need it — you can do one-way visualizations without it.

#### Reactor is useful for getting two-way interactivity working, if you need to talk back to FileMaker. Can also use MBS plugin for that.
